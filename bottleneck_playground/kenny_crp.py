"""
A crp partition is represented by three lists: a list of counts for clusters, a list of labels for those clusters, and a list of assignments for
objects indicating which table they belong to.
Base gives the probability of each label (i.e. the nth element of base gives the probability of label n).
Uses gamma function from numpy, but the numpy types there were causing problems, so cast the result of gamma function to a normal python float.
Using logs is probably a better idea though.

Same calculation, but in the log domain.
Note: assumes base is in log_domain.
